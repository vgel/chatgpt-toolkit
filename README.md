# ChatGPT-toolkit

A small helper script that adds a snippet manager to ChatGPT. It comes with a few default snippets, as well as allowing you to add your own that are persisted to localStorage.

To activate the script, open the ChatGPT page and click the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar (Ctrl+Shift+B). Then the command palette will become usable. You'll need to do this on every page refresh / reload (if the palette doesn't seem to be working, try clicking the bookmarklet again).

## How to use

Press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K on MacOS) to open the palette. Start typing to filter, and use the arrow keys and enter or the mouse to select. Snippets will immediately send when selected.

You can use the built-in snippets or add your own. Custom snippets are stored in localStorage in a simple format, if you'd like to bulk-import your own.

## Tips

Some of the snippets won't work on the first try -- you can reroll by pressing "Try Again" if you get a disapproving answer. Generally those kinds of snippets work best at the start of a conversation.

## Developing / Contributing

My current (janky) workflow is to edit the .ts files, run `./build.sh | xclip`, then paste the result into devtools and test. Feel free to let me know if you come up with a better solution :-)

## Dependencies

The palette library is [ninja-keys](https://github.com/ssleptsov/ninja-keys) (Sergei Sleptsov, MIT). It's loaded at runtime from Unpkg.
